    uint amountOutMin,
    address[] calldata path,
    address to,
    uint deadline
) external virtual override ensure(deadline) returns (uint[] memory amounts) {
    amounts = UniswapV2Library.getAmountsOut(factory, amountIn, path);
    require(amounts[amounts.length - 1] >= amountOutMin, 'UniswapV2Router: INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT_AMOUNT');
    TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
        path[0], msg.sender, UniswapV2Library.pairFor(factory, path[0], path[1]), amounts[0]
    );

Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method: `call`

Explanation

Purpose: 
The `swapExactTokensForTokens` function in the UniswapV2Router02 contract facilitates the swapping of a specific amount of input tokens for a minimum amount of output tokens along a specified path. This function is essential for enabling token swaps on the Uniswap platform.

Detailed Usage:
The function utilizes the `call` method indirectly within the `_swap` function to execute the actual token swap. The `call` method allows the contract to interact with other contracts in a low-level manner, ensuring the swap operations are performed securely and efficiently. The method achieves this by calling the `swap` function of the pair contracts corresponding to the tokens being swapped.

Here's how the function works:
1. Get Output Amounts: It calculates the output amounts using the `UniswapV2Library.getAmountsOut` function.
2. Ensure Minimum Output: It checks if the last output amount is greater than or equal to the minimum specified amount (`amountOutMin`).
3. Transfer Tokens: It transfers the input tokens from the sender to the first pair contract in the path using `TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom`.
4. Perform Swap: It calls the `_swap` function, which executes the token swaps by interacting with the pair contracts via `call`.

Impact:
The `call` method's use within this function is crucial for enabling the decentralized, trustless token swap mechanism that Uniswap is known for. By leveraging `call`, the contract can securely and efficiently interact with various token pair contracts, ensuring the swaps are executed as intended. This functionality is central to Uniswap's operation, providing liquidity and facilitating decentralized trading.
